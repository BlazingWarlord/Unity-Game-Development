# Unity-Game-Development
A Set of Games made by me using Unity Game Development Engine and C# Scripts.

This contains 2 Unity projects. todo.apk is an app to maintain to to-do list. Use the button in the top to add a task and the red button near the added tasks to remove it.
It's an android app and has a back-end data storage mechanism.

Windows-Build folder actually has an exe file of a game made with Unity and C#. I was only able to upload the .exe file since the asset files were too big to upload in GitHub.
