# Unity-Game-Development
A Set of Games made by me using Unity Game Development Engine and C# Scripts.

This contains 2 Unity projects. todo.apk is an app to maintain to to-do list. Use the button in the top to add a task and the red button near the added tasks to remove it.
It's an android app and has a back-end data storage mechanism.

Windows-Build folder actually has an exe file of a game made with Unity and C#. I was only able to upload the .exe file since the asset files were too big to upload in GitHub. Extract the folder to find the .exe game. The game is called "Will you be my friend ?" and was my entry to Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2.
